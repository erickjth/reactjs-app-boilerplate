# Theme definition

Here lives the theme for your application, including spacing, colors, and typography.

This boilerplate does not includes a specific library to handle the theme definition.

Some options could be:

-   Material Design
-   ChakraUI
-   Antd

Or it can includes something from scratch using libraries like:

-   Emotion
-   Styled Component
-   Styled-System
-   ThemeUI
