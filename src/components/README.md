# Components

This is where your React components will live. The first level groups the components by modules, e.g. there are two well defined groups, `common` where components commonly used like Button, Typography, Form Controls, etc, will live. Also, the `layout` which includes every component related to common containers elements that normally comes from a design UI.

## Example

```
├── components
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── button
│   │   ├── typography
│   │   ├── icon
│   │   ├── text-input
│   ├── layout
│   ├── [module-name-1]
│   ├── [module-name-2]
```
